# Monorepo for AI Avatar, Backend Services, and Frontend Application

This monorepo hosts three distinct but related projects:

*   **AI Avatar**: A project focused on generating AI avatars with lip-sync capabilities.
*   **Backend Services**: A FastAPI application providing various backend functionalities including steganography, text generation, and database interactions.
*   **Frontend Application**: A Next.js web application that serves as the user interface for accessing and utilizing the features offered by the AI Avatar and Backend Services projects.

## Sub-Projects

### 1. AI Avatar

*   **Purpose**: This project is dedicated to generating AI avatars with realistic lip-sync capabilities. It leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to create engaging and interactive avatar experiences.
*   **Key Technologies**:
    *   Vertex AI
    *   ElevenLabs
    *   Rhubarb Lip Sync
    *   Node.js
*   **Setup and Usage**: For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the `ai-avatar/ai-avatar-backend/README.md` file within this project.

### 2. Backend Services

*   **Purpose**: This project consists of a FastAPI application that provides a range of backend services. These services include steganography (encoding and decoding text within images), advanced text generation using large language models (LLMs), and various database operations.
*   **Key Technologies**:
    *   Python
    *   FastAPI
    *   MongoDB
    *   Gemini
    *   Gemma
*   **Setup and Usage**: To set up and use this project, you will need to install the dependencies listed in `backend/requirements.txt` and run the application using `backend/main.py`. Detailed instructions for API usage can be inferred from the FastAPI documentation generated by the application itself when it's running.

### 3. Frontend Application

*   **Purpose**: This project is a Next.js web application that serves as the primary user interface for interacting with the features and services provided by the AI Avatar and Backend Services projects. It offers a user-friendly experience for accessing the various functionalities.
*   **Key Technologies**:
    *   Next.js
    *   React
    *   TailwindCSS
    *   Avatech AI (likely for avatar display/interaction)
    *   Clerk (for user authentication)
*   **Setup and Usage**: For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the `frontend/README.md` file within this project.

## Overall Project Setup and Prerequisites

To successfully run all projects within this monorepo, you'll need to ensure the following prerequisites are met:

*   **Node.js**: Required for the `ai-avatar` (backend) and `frontend` projects. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Python**: Required for the `backend` project. Download and install from [python.org](https://python.org/).
*   **MongoDB**: Required for the `backend` project if you intend to use its database functionalities. Ensure you have a running MongoDB instance. Download and install from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).
*   **API Keys**:
    *   The `ai-avatar` project requires API keys for Vertex AI and ElevenLabs. Refer to `ai-avatar/ai-avatar-backend/README.md` for instructions on how to configure these.
    *   The `backend` project might require API keys for Gemini and Gemma if you are using those specific features. (Details would typically be in a `.env.example` or similar configuration file within the `backend` project - *Developer Note: Add this if it exists*).
*   **Rhubarb Lip Sync**: The `ai-avatar` project requires the Rhubarb Lip Sync executable. Refer to `ai-avatar/ai-avatar-backend/README.md` for download and setup instructions.

### Installing Dependencies

For each project, navigate to its respective directory and install the dependencies:

*   **ai-avatar (backend)**:
    ```bash
    cd ai-avatar/ai-avatar-backend
    yarn install  # or npm install
    cd ../..
    ```
*   **backend (Python)**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    ```
    *Note: It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment for this project.*
*   **frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    yarn install  # or npm install / pnpm install / bun install
    cd ..
    ```

## Running the Entire Application

To run the entire application, you'll generally need to start the backend services first, followed by the frontend application. The AI Avatar project might have its own server that needs to be run if it's not integrated into the main backend or frontend flows directly.

1.  **Start MongoDB**: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.
2.  **Start the Backend Services (`backend` project)**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000 --reload
    # Adjust host and port as needed, based on your uvicorn setup in main.py
    cd ..
    ```
3.  **Start the AI Avatar Backend (`ai-avatar/ai-avatar-backend` project)**:
    ```bash
    cd ai-avatar/ai-avatar-backend
    yarn dev # or the appropriate command from its README
    cd ../..
    ```
4.  **Start the Frontend Application (`frontend` project)**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    yarn dev # or npm run dev / pnpm dev / bun dev
    cd ..
    ```

Once all services are running, you should be able to access the frontend application, typically at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the frontend project's development server).

*Note: The exact commands and order might vary slightly based on the specific configurations and interdependencies of the projects. Always refer to the individual README files for the most accurate information.*
